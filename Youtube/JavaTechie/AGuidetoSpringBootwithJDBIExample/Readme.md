# A Guide to Spring Boot with JDBI Example  | Java Techie

* Tutorial you're going to see Patti's JDBI and how it before from JDBC Show ZTV is one convenience library, which is built on top of GTBC Normally we are using ZTVC api to interrupt with our database. Similarly, jdbi will be the one that wrapped Jdbc to get the prepare statement, execute against the database. So if you observe internally, the Z dvc driver is the one that executes the transaction. JTBI just works as intermediate and. the advantages of using this ZDBI it is lighter than all over M from up like hibernate and it really helps to split up development and have everything more clean and clear. And it make our code more easier as we have lot of utilities and using this spring GDI we can perform the functional programming like using annotation. Also you can perform the query like how we are doing in spring data GPA So we will understand more once we start the development. So let us quickly create an application engine spring good. Then we will observe step by step. Now open the clips.
