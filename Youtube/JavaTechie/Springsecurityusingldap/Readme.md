# Spring security using ldap | Java Techie

* In this tutorial, we are going to see spring security using elder So let's start with basic what is end up and why we need it End up as the name suggests, it is lightweight directory access protocol So we can say elder Vijay Sarper or Elda Vijay database. It is simply one lightweight directory access protocol. So the main purpose to use elder vis for authentication, like, suppose my application is Intranet application, which used by very lace means countable people. Then, instead of doing role based authentication using database, we should use elder security And it can be, it can be used for data which is common. And everyone uses, for example Basic information of employee can be stored, since that is used by many teams and many times And the end of his faster than traditional RDMS, but it cannot handle huge data. So basically LDA means here one file. The extension is LDIF, where we can configure the user name, password and the domain and specific organization and pattern. There we can specify instead of database So now let us get start the development. Let us quickly do one small POC on it. So let us create a spring good application. Strings shutter project.
